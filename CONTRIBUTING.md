## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This project uses an AI-assisted development workflow with Claude and Claude Code. All contributions should follow this collaborative approach.

## Development Process

### 1. Issue Creation and Planning
- Create detailed issues with acceptance criteria
- Use issue templates for consistency
- Tag issues with AI collaboration indicators

### 2. AI-Assisted Implementation
- Use Claude for architecture and design decisions
- Generate initial code with Claude Code
- Document AI interactions and decisions

### 3. Human Review and Validation
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed by humans
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly
- Validate business logic and requirements

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Use AI-generated test suites as starting point
- Add domain-specific test cases
- Ensure 95%+ test coverage

## Code Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting
- Use type hints for all functions
- Document all public APIs with docstrings
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

### AI Collaboration Standards
- Document AI prompts and responses in commit messages
- Tag commits with AI collaboration level (ai-generated, ai-assisted, human-only)
- Include AI decision rationale in code comments when relevant

## Commit Message Format
```
[ai-level] Component: Description

Detailed description of changes
AI collaboration notes if applicable

Resolves: #issue-number
```

AI levels:
- `ai-generated`: Code primarily generated by AI
- `ai-assisted`: Human code with AI assistance
- `human-only`: Manually written code

## Branch Naming
- `feature/ai-generated/[component]-[description]` for AI-generated features
- `feature/[issue-number]-[description]` for standard features
- `bugfix/[issue-number]-[description]` for bug fixes

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Add AI collaboration notes to PR description
4. Request review from both human reviewers and AI validation

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Documentation Standards
- Update API documentation for all public interfaces
- Add user guide sections for new features
- Document AI collaboration decisions in ADRs
- Include examples and usage scenarios
