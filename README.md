## Overview

Multi-application platform for ScoutBook data processing, automation, and reporting. Each application focuses on a specific aspect of Scouting data management while sharing common components for efficiency and consistency.

## Applications

### Merit Badge Counselor (MBC) Pipeline âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
**Location**: `apps/mbc/`

Complete automated pipeline that scrapes Merit Badge Counselor data from ScoutBook, processes troop rosters, and generates professional reports.

**Features:**
- âœ… Browser automation with Playwright (handles slow ScoutBook responses)
- âœ… Full pagination support for counselor search results
- âœ… Intelligent roster processing with multi-troop support
- âœ… Professional HTML/PDF reports with Eagle badge highlighting ðŸ¦…
- âœ… Smart exclusion list with flexible name matching
- âœ… Data archival with timestamped directories

**Current Results:**
- **61 adults** processed from T32 and T7012 rosters
- **8 troop counselors** identified (13.1% of adults)
- **139 merit badges** analyzed for coverage
- **6 reports** generated per run (HTML + PDF)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd apps/mbc
python src/merit_badge_counselor_scraper.py  # Scrape MBC data (15-30 min)
python src/roster_processor.py               # Process rosters (< 1 min)
python src/report_generator.py               # Generate reports (< 1 min)
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Applications

1. **Create Application Directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p apps/{app_name}/{src,data,docs}
mkdir -p apps/{app_name}/data/{input,scraped,processed,reports}
```

2. **Follow Standard Structure:**
- `src/` - Application-specific code
- `data/input/` - Input files (including exclusion lists)
- `data/scraped/` - Raw scraped data
- `data/processed/` - Cleaned/transformed data  
- `data/reports/` - Generated outputs
- `docs/` - Application documentation

3. **Leverage Shared Components:**
- Import utilities from `shared/` packages
- Follow established patterns from existing applications
- Contribute reusable code back to shared components

4. **Documentation Requirements:**
- `README.md` - Application overview and usage
- `docs/EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step instructions
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Technical specifications

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Current Applications Status

| Application | Status | Key Metrics | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **MBC Pipeline** | âœ… **Production** | 61 adults, 8 MBCs, 139 badges | Complete automation of Merit Badge Counselor reporting |
