## Project Overview

Enterprise-grade Python application demonstrating AI-assisted development practices for Scouting America data integration and automated reporting.

### Initial Effort
- The initial effort entailed iteratively refining an expansive specification with Claude Sonnet 4 to generate the desired reporting.
- A simple but effective CLI interface was implemented.
- Multiple file input formats were experimented with.
- Claude generated all of the code.
- Interactive debugging sessions with Claude occurred to successfully resolve all issues and conclude this effort.

### Integration of GitHub, VS Code, and Claude Code into Project
- The next step was to integrate Claude Code 4 into VS Code and create a ScoutBook repository in GitHub.
- Claude Sonnet 4 guided this integration effort.
- The goals of the project were expanded using Claude Sonnet as a development partner. It helped refine details in specifications and recommended repository file hierarchy.
- The ScoutBook repository is located at https://github.com/iwolf81/scoutbook/tree/main .
- The specifications from the initial effort are located in https://github.com/iwolf81/scoutbook/tree/main/legacy/specifications .
- The reports generated from the initial effort are located in https://github.com/iwolf81/scoutbook/tree/main/legacy/test_outputs/MBC_Reports_2025-06-04_14-51/html .

### Refinement of Interactions with Claude
- As this project progressed, I found Claude's recommended goals, specifications, GitHub file hierarchy, and interactive responses to be over reaching and overly verbose to the point where they became a hindrance to good progress.
- Additionally, with each new context, I had to 're-initialize' Claude with my background and software development philosophies.
- With Claude's guidance, I created an ai-context repository to contain all relevant information about my background, philosophies, and desired interaction style with AIs.
- Claude is directed to process the markdown files located in https://github.com/iwolf81/ai-context at the start of each new context.

### Next Steps
- Re-generate project goals, specification, and GitHub file hierarchy with new context using ai-context markdown files.
- Carefully scrape data from ScoutBook databases instead of manually downloading reports for processing.
- Create a GUI interface that supports use by leaders of multiple units.
- Integrate an automated unit testing framework.
- Continue to log progress in this README.md file.
