### Known Issues Identified
1. **ScoutBook vs Public Website Naming**: Different naming conventions require careful handling
2. **VS Code Workspace Context**: File completion issues with multi-folder workspace setup
3. **Claude Code Extension**: May not be properly installed/configured

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Install Claude Code Extension**: Resolve VS Code integration issues
2. **Test Merit Badge Fixes**: Verify "Citizenship in the World" now appears in reports
3. **Validate Fish and Wildlife**: Confirm correct naming matches ScoutBook data

### Enhancement Development (GitHub Issues)
1. **Issue #1 Implementation**: Dynamic merit badge extraction from official sources
2. **Issue #2 Implementation**: Prioritized counselor assignment system
3. **Unit Leader Classification**: Implement three-tier priority system

### Future Enhancements
- **Web-based Configuration**: Interface for counselor priority management
- **Automated Updates**: Scheduled merit badge list refresh from official sources
- **Additional Unit Support**: Expand beyond T32/T7012 to other troops

## Development Environment

### Repository Structure
- **Apps Directory**: `apps/mbc/` - Merit Badge Counselor pipeline
- **Shared Components**: `shared/` - Reusable utilities
- **Legacy Reference**: `legacy/` - Historical implementations
- **Data Protection**: `.gitignore` excludes personal information

### Multi-Repo Workspace
- **Primary**: `scoutbook` (this repository)
- **Secondary**: `beascout` (related HNE Council project)
- **Reference**: `ai-context` (development guidelines)

### Tools & Dependencies
- **Python**: Merit badge processing and report generation
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for ScoutBook scraping
- **GitHub**: Issue tracking and version control
- **VS Code**: Development environment with workspace configuration

## Session Continuity Notes

### Context Preservation
- **Conversation History**: Complete discussion of merit badge fixes and enhancements
- **Technical Decisions**: Rationale for external file approach and naming standardization

### Key Insights Discovered
- **Naming Inconsistencies**: ScoutBook uses different names than public website
- **Data Validation**: Importance of using authoritative ScoutBook source for accuracy
- **User Experience**: Need for counselor prioritization to reduce unit leader burden

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Issue-Driven Development**: Using GitHub issues for enhancement planning
- **Documentation-First**: Updating docs alongside code changes
- **Production Focus**: Emphasizing real-world usability over legacy recreation
